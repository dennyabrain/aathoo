	<h1>Plan for an elaborate prank on my son</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<p>
I want to raise my son in my hometown in India. I have devised this genius prank to play on him when he is born. I will raise him in my backyard isolated from the rest of the world. He'll never step out of my house till he is 40. By then all his habits should have crystallized and there would be no new opinion to be formed. I will only talk to him in a Chinese language (I haven't decided which one yet.  This plan is a work in progress.  Maybe Mandarin but that might change. I will let you know). We will eat Chinese food together. I will only rent Chinese DVDs so that he is taken into the world of Wong Kar-wai, John Woo and Zhang Yimou. I hope he begins to construct the meaning of life from those stories. To him all movies will be from the fantasy genre because for him the world does not exist beyond the boundaries of my house. There's only a carefully constructed replica of the world depicted in the movies in his head but he will grow up thinking that the world outside the house is a big expanse of darkness. That's what I will tell him. </br></br></p>

<p>When he is 12, around the age when puberty sneaks up on him like a ninja, he will get elaborate answers from me about the human body, carefully composed in an exquisite Chinese language.  When he asks me how come there are no more people in the world, I will know that what he really wants to know is- where are all the girls? To which I will reply that the Indians killed them all and that if we step out, they will kill us too. He wouldn't know till then what Indians are. He'll spend days conjuring up images of the Indian race in his head but he won't get it right. Beause Indians are a multi-racial group, duh!</br></br> </p>
<p>At the age of 25, he will finally muster up the courage to ask me why I, his father, do not look like a Chinese man. (Readers bear in mind that our house will have no mirrors. At this point he still doesn't realize he is Indian by race. Hilarious, right?) To which I will reply with a sigh, "I don't know. Maybe God doesn't like me as much as he likes you" and then weep uncontrollably. That should leave him guilty for bringing up something that obviously only a devil child would bring up.</br></br></p>
<p>The age of 40 would be life shattering for him. This is when I abandon him out in the world. I would hate to use sedatives. Maybe by then science would have caught up and discovered something that could teleport a person from one place to another. In the worst casescenario that science is still run by nerds with lab-coats, I will use sedative. I won't let science or my seemingly-irrational-but-probably-backed-by-statistics-fear of accidental self-sedation stop me.</br></br></p>
<p>When he wakes up on the day of his 40th birthday he will wake up in the middle of New Delhi, surrounded by people who will ask him in Hindi who he was.To which he would have wondered, "what do you mean by 'was'? I still 'am'", if only he know Hindi.</br></br></p>
<p>I suppose the next one year will be full of discoveries for him. I can't wait to hear about them when I meet him later on in life.</p>
<p>All this while he will have one question at the back of his mind. No, not the back. This is probably the one thing he'd have on his mind. If not, then I would have failed as a master prankster. </br></br>
Why? Why did his father do this? Or Was it a dream all along? Can a dream last 40 years? Why does everyone look at him when he uses chopsticks?
There are no answers to be found here. All he'll feel is an inability to comprehend why Indians were against Chinese excursions into Indian territory. He'll feel left out in political debates at tea-stalls across India because he will always find himself leaning in favour of the Chinese argument. He'll never know why he likes girls from North East India so much.</br></br> </p>
<p>He will once in his lifetime console a victim of racial abuseg from Sikkim and while hugging her say. "I understand. I am one of you." To which she will reply, "Umm... No you're not". He'll live the rest of his life resenting women in general.</br></br> </p
>
<p>When he turns 41 on his 41st birthday, I'm going to reappear in his life. </br></br>
He will have lots of questions at this point, I presume. </br></br>
Hopefully I'd have had enough time to think of satisfactory answers by then. What I have till now is - I will try to convince him that his mother was Chinese and somehow make it seem like it was her dying wish. You know all that stuff inspired from Bollywood movies. I am really counting on the fact that he wouldn't have gotten time to catch up on movies in the one eventful year he is away from me. If he does, then this plan is foiled. I will justify all my deeds one by one till he breaks down and cries on my shoulders and call me 父亲, which for you uncivilized readers, translates to 'Father' </br></br>  </p>

<p>Now, onwards with my search for a woman to plant my seed in...</p>
