	<h1>Plan for an elaborate prank on my son</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<p>
I want to raise my son in my hometown in India. I have devised this genius prank to play on him when he is born. I will raise him in my backyard isolated from the rest of the world. He'll never step out of my house till he is 40 when all his habits have been made and there is nothing new in life to learn about. I will only talk to him in a Chinese language (I haven't decided which one yet.  This plan is a work in progress.  Maybe Mandarin but that might change. I will let you know). We will eat Chinese food together. I will rent Chinese DVDs so that he is taken into the world of Wong Kar-wai, John Woo and Zhang Yimou. I hope he begins to construct meaning in there. </p>

<p>When he is 12, around the age when puberty sneaks up on him like a ninja, he will get elaborate answers from me about the human body, carefully composed in an exquisite Chinese language.  When he asks me how come there are no more people in the world, I will know that what he really wants to know is Where all the girls are. To which I will tell him that the Indians killed them all and that if we step out, they will kill us too. </p>
<p>At the age of 25, he will finally muster up the courage to ask me why I, his father, do not look like a Chinese man. (Readers bear in mind that our house will have no mirrors. At this point he still doesn't realize he is Indian by race. Hilarious, right?) To which I will reply with a sigh, "I don't know. Maybe God doesn't like me as much as he likes you" and then weep uncontrollably. That should leave him guilty for bring up something that obviously only a devil child would bring up.</p>
<p>The age of 40 would be life shattering for him. This is when I abandon him out in the world. I would hate to use sedatives. Maybe by then science would have caught up and discovered something that could teleport a person from one place to another. In the worst case, I will use sedative. I won't let science or my fear of accidental self-sedation stop me.</p>
<p>When he wakes up on the day of his 40th birthday he will wake up in the middle of New Delhi, surrounded by people who will ask him in Hindi who he was. To which he will reply in some Chinese dialect.</p>
<p>I suppose the next one year will be full of discoveries for him. I can't wait to hear about them when I meet him later on in life.</p>
<p>All this while he will have one question at the back of his mind. No, not the back. This is probably be the one thing he'd want to know all the time as he leads his life.
Why? Why did his father do this?
He'll never know why. There are no answers to be found here. All he'll feel is an inability to comprehend his sympathy for Chinese excursions into Indian territory. He'll feel left out in political debates at tea-stalls across India because he will always find himself leaning in favour of the Chinese argument. He'll never know why he likes girls from North East India so much. </p>
<p>He will once in his lifetime console a victim of racial profiling from Sikkim and while hugging her say. "I understand. I am one of you." To which she will reply, "Umm... No you're not". He'll live the rest of his life resenting women in general. </p
>
<p>And when He's 40, I'm gonna make a reappearance into his life.
He will have lots of questions at this point, I presume. 
Hopefully I'd have had time to work on some of the answers by then. I will tell him that his mother was Chinese when obviously that will be a lie. I will tell him it was her dying wish that he be raised in the Chinese tradition and thus one after the other I will justify all my deeds till he breaks down and cries on my shoulders and call me 父亲, which for you uncivilized readers, translates to 'Father'  </p>
